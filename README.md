A hands-on introduction to the computer-based analysis of genomic and biomolecular data through the use of widely available modern open source techniques.
Computational and statistical analysis to decipher biology from genome sequences and related data, including both DNA and RNA sequence as well as other 
"post-genomic" data (i.e., experimental data obtained with technologies that require the genome sequence, such as genomic DNA microarrays).
